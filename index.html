            <p>
                Dear fellow Statisticians in Uppsala,
                I have the pleasure to invite you all to this year's Upp-Upp conference (the internal conference for Statisticians in Uppsala). This time, it will take place at the Ångström laboratory on <strong>March 14, 8.45-13</strong>. For details, see the attached pdf file.
                Fika and a lunch sandwich will be served.
                All talks are 20 minutes long with 5 minutes time for questions and discussion afterwards.
            </p>

                <p>Bayesian Models for National-Scale Disease Spread: From Cattle to COVID-19.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="abstract" id="Abstract-Engblom">
                In this talk, I will present Bayesian modeling approaches for tracking and predicting infectious disease spread at a
                national scale. These methods enhance real-time monitoring and also help improve our understanding of the disease
                dynamics. 
                I will first discuss the endemic spread of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli in Swedish cattle, where sparse and low-
                informative prevalence data, combined with a decade-long transport network, pose interesting challenges. Despite these
                limitations, our Bayesian simulation-driven approach successfully reconstructs disease spread, producing an in silico
                model with predictive value. <br> <br>
                Next, I will highlight a COVID-19 modeling effort from the cross-disciplinary CRUSH Covid project at Uppsala
                University, launched in October 2020 to support local authorities. Here, we developed a time-continuous compartmental
                model, structurally akin to a chemical reaction network, with parameters estimated using Bayesian techniques and a
                Kalman filter applied to healthcare data. This approach yielded valuable insights into pandemic dynamics, while also
                underscoring the complexities and uncertainties inherent in real-time epidemiological modeling.

            </div>
            <p class="abstract" id="Abstract-Eriksson">A good approach for parameter estimation in autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) models is the maximum
                likelihood method (MLE). The inverse Fisher's information matrix (FIM) is an often used estimator for the variance-
                covariance matrix (VCM) of the MLE. The small sample properties of several FIM-based estimators for the VCM of
                the MLE are investigated in a Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the Box-Jenkins asymptotic estimator and the FIM
                performed best in respect to mean squared error (MSE) and relative bias. Though the observed FIM performed worst in
                respect to same measures, it is however best for providing moderately conservative confidence intervals for ARMA
                parameters.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="abstract" id="Abstract-Rezaei">This research addresses the problem of estimating the mean vector of a multivariate normal distribution when the
                covariance matrix is unknown. We develop an extended class of Bayes estimators under the quadratic loss
                function and investigate their minimax properties. Building upon previous works, we generalize the minimax Bayes
                estimators by incorporating a hierarchical prior structure where the covariance matrix follows a Wishart distribution.
                Our approach leads to an extended Bayes estimator that satisfies minimaxity conditions under specific regularity
                constraints. The results contribute to the broader literature on shrinkage estimation in high-dimensional regression
                analysis. <br> <br>

            <p class="abstract" id="Abstract-Avelin">High dimensional data sets are today ubiquitous in many areas of research, and understanding them is of central
                importance. Such a data set is commonly assumed to lie on some unknown manifold, and in this talk I will describe and
                introduce methods one can use to study the geometry of these manifolds, based mainly on the Graph Laplacian. In
                particular I will focus on how one can detect singularities, such as self intersections. <br> <br>

                <p>Moment matching based sparse and noisy point cloud registration.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="abstract" id="Abstract-Yang">Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), particularly in
                robotics applications where sensor data is often sparse and noisy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to point
                cloud registration based on moment matching, specifically designed to handle challenging conditions such as low point
                density and measurement noise. Our method is applied to millimeter-wave radar data collected from a moving vehicle,
                demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. A key advantage of our approach is its computational efficiency.
                We ensure that registration between consecutive frames is completed within 100 milliseconds, making it suitable for
                real-time applications. Additionally, we evaluate the accuracy of our method by comparing it against widely used
                registration techniques. Despite operating on significantly sparser radar data, our method achieves comparable accuracy
                to state-of-the-art LiDAR-based approaches, which rely on much denser point clouds. These results highlight the
                potential of moment matching as an efficient and robust solution for point cloud registration in SLAM, particularly in
                resource-constrained environments where dense LiDAR scans are not available.</p>

            <p class="abstract" id="Abstract-Brömssen">Swedish environmental monitoring programmes collect large amount of data to follow the state of the environment as
                well as prevailing changes over time. For some programmes the data structure does not allow the use of traditional trend
                analysis methods, as the temporal resolution is too low. Here, we focus on the analysis of temporal trends for chemical
                variables from the Swedish lake survey with observations once each six years in a rotating panel for a total of 4800
                lakes.</p>

            <p class="abstract" id="Abstract-Ekström">In contrast to statistical procedures relying on a fixed sample
                size, sequential analysis allows for dynamic decision-making as data is
                collected. In this way, sequential methods reduce the average number of
                observations required to obtain a certain level of precision, but by how
                much? To answer this, we restrict our attention to a stylized problem
                formulation of testing the drift of a Brownian motion, for which the
                reduction can be quantified</p>
